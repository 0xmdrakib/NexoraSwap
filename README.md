Nexora Swap is live 🚀 (made with love and passion❤️)

A multi-router DEX UI that makes swaps feels clean: 
• Same-chain: Auto (best) between @1inch + @lifiprotocol
• Cross-chain: @lifiprotocol  + @gasdotzip  (bridge + swap). 
• Clean min received, balances + USD, gas, bridge fee, and human-friendly errors.
• And using these 3 router you can enjoy multiple DEX and liquidity provider in one platform. (and it's open source)

Try it: https://nexoraswap.online

2/ Routing logic (simple, predictable):

✅ Same chain → Auto compares routes (@1inch  vs @lifiprotocol )
✅ Cross chain → Auto compares routes (@lifiprotocol  vs @gasdotzip ) 
✅ You can manually switch the route any time.

And UI shows which dex/liquidity used.

3/ Supported chains (7):

• @ethereum • @base • @0xPolygon • @arbitrum • @Optimism • @BNBCHAIN • @avax 
• One UI, multiple chains - no tab-hopping.
• You can trade almost all token in these chain.

(So you can go wherever liquidity lives without changing apps.)

4/ The “pro UX” bits I cared about:

• Token selector + chain selector inside both From & To 
• Wallet balances + USD shown next to tokens 
• Custom token add by contract address (per chain) 
• Slippage control + Minimum received (token + USD) 
• Exact approvals (no infinite approve)
• Bridge fee for cross chain swap
• Manual Router select option
• UI will show almost clear text of any error or from and to token amount is too different, and etc.

5/ Bridge transparency (cross-chain):

When a route needs native value / fees, the UI shows: 
• Bridge DEX fee (est.) + USD 
• Wallet will send (tx value) + USD

So you’re not surprised by what the wallet is actually paying.

6/ Token data:

• Wallet token scanning + metadata + logos via @moralisdevs  
• Price fallback when needed (so UI doesn’t go blank)

If a token logo/price is missing, reply with the token + chain and I’ll patch it fast.

7/ I made with love so if have any issue I’d love to receive real feedback

Reply with: 
• chain / dex
• token pair 
• what felt confusing / slow 

Next upgrades I’m considering: More clean + faster UI, better route details, more swap route, and many more. Let’s make swaps less painful. 🧠⚡️
